### Ruby Style Guide Suggestions (According to Shopify)

*  Make all lines of your methods operate on the same level of abstraction. *(Single Level of Abstraction Principle)*
  By making each have a single functionality or responsibility not only leads to better organized code but for better readability and refactoring.
