Life is good, until you want better.  Before enter a coding bootcamp I was given the typical advised and warnings before starting such as "prepare for a difficult journey" and such. They all have a place and time why they are consistently told. But while going through the process I learned that its difficult because it helps build character and resilience. These and many more that could many coders could agree upon are what makes the entire process from inception to developer so life changing.   Smile Eat Sleep and Code.
