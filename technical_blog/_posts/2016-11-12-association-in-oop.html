Association in Object Oriented Programming (OOP) represents a relationship between objects.<br />Each object is independent of each others life cycle and owner.<br />A good life example would be in a school setting were you have multiple students interacting with a teacher or where one student can interact with multiple teachers. In both situation both students and teachers are independent of each others.
